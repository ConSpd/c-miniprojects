# Cosine and Sine calculator

The script calculates the sine and cosine of a $x$ angle that is given in degrees.

The calculations of sine and cosine are being carried out by the formulas:

$\sin(x) = x - \frac{x^3}{3!} + \frac{x^5}{5!} + \frac{x^7}{7!} + \frac{x^9}{9!}...$

$\cos(x) = 1 - \frac{x^2}{2!} + \frac{x^4}{4!} + \frac{x^6}{6!} + \frac{x^8}{8!}...$
